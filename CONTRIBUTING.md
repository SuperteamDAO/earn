### Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to act professionally and respectfully, and we expect our social channels to be a safe and enjoyable environment for all.

### How to Contribute

1. **Update your fork:** Before you make any changes, make sure your fork is up to date with the main branch.
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```
2. **Create a new branch:** Create a new branch where you'll do your work.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-new-feature
    ```
3. **Make your changes:** Make the necessary changes to the code or documentation.

4. **Check for Lint Errors:** To maintain code quality, run the linting process.
    ```bash
    yarn lint
    ```
> **Note:** If errors occur, run `yarn format` to fix and remove lint errors before committing.

5. **Commit your changes:** Once you've made your changes, commit them.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add some feature"
    ```
6. **Push your changes:** Push the changes to your new branch on your fork.
    ```bash
    git push origin my-new-feature
    ```
7. **Create a pull request:** Go to your fork on GitHub and click the 'Compare & pull request' button next to your new branch to create a new pull request.

### Pull Requests

- The pull request should be related to an issue. If an issue doesn't exist for your contribution, create one.
- The pull request should have a descriptive title and any necessary explanations in the comments.
- Make sure your pull request is based on the latest commits to avoid conflicts.

### Style Guidelines

- Please adhere to the existing coding style.
- Write your code in TypeScript and follow best practices.

### Review Process
- A maintainer will review the pull request and provide feedback or merge it.
- If changes are required, make them and push them to the same branch, and the pull request will automatically update.
