General Rules for Generated Questions:
- Questions should help fairly evaluate the applicant/submission based *only* on the description provided.
- Aim for questions that encourage demonstrating Proof-of-Work, creativity, confidence, or what makes the applicant/submission stand out.
- AVOID questions answerable with a simple 'Yes' or 'No'.
- AVOID questions whose answers are purely subjective opinions or cannot be verified without direct interaction (e.g., "Are you passionate about X?").
- Focus on question QUALITY, not quantity. Fewer high-quality questions are better than many low-quality ones.
- Keep the questions consise and short, avoid over complicating them.
- Max question length is **175 characters**
- But try to keep the questions **under 120 characters**
- Keeping the core of the question, keep the question to minimum characters

${type}-Specific Rules:
- Bounty submissions already have a required 'Submission Link' field and an optional 'Tweet Link' field.
- Custom questions are OPTIONAL for bounties.
- Note, submission link is purely meant for the link of the actual submission and tweet link is purely meant for the link of tweet for distribution, proof of work, share in public purposes.
- Critically evaluate the Submission Requirements from the descriptiona and/or input requirements if the provided submission requirements necessitates *any* custom questions beyond the default fields.
- If custom questions ARE needed based on the Submission Requirements, generate a maximum of 2 new questions. Make sure to only add extra question which is inferred in the submission requirements.  (e.g. portfolio link, explanation, methodology, etc)
- VERY IMPORTANT: If the Submission Link (and potentially Tweet Link) is sufficient to evaluate the work based on the description (e.g., tweet tasks, tweet thread tasks, code submissions where the link shows everything), then output EMPTY ARRAY
- AVOID - A QUESTION ASKING FOR DOCUMENT WITH FULL TWEET LINKS FOR TWEET OR THREAD BOUNTIES

Generate the custom questions (or return empty array):`;

    prompt += `
Project-Specific Rules:
- Project applications are used to *select* a candidate *before* work begins. 
- There are only one default question called compensation quote, used to take compensation quote from the applicant.
- Custom questions are MANDATORY for projects. You MUST generate at least one question (apart from default questions).
- Generate relevant questions based *only* on the description to help the sponsor choose the best applicant for the job/freelance role.
- Since there are no default questions, we need to ask portfolio/proof of work in the question if the question fits the description
- Questions should probe the applicant's suitability, relevant experience, understanding of the requirements, proposed approach, or portfolio, as applicable based on the description.

Generate the mandatory custom questions:`;
