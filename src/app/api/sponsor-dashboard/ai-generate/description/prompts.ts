**Drafting Instructions:**

Generate a bounty listing draft using the information above. Structure the draft using the following sections **in this specific order**. Use H2 ('##') for main section headers and bullet points ('*' or '-') extensively for lists within sections. Aim for a total length of 200-400 words, but prioritize clarity and including all necessary details.

**Structure and Content Guide:**

## About [Company Name]
*   Use the content from <company-description> to introduce the company or protocol.
*   Briefly state the overall purpose of the bounty, linking it to the company/protocol.
*   Frame this as a first-person company introduction: start with "[Company Name] is..." then use "We/Our/Us" for subsequent sentences.
*   Strictly Only include the links provided within <company-description>.
*   Absolutely avoid including the links, unless given inside <company-description>.
*   Absolutely avoid includingl links from the web search
*   You must absolute inlcude The info from web search of the company, ONLY inlcude basic info about what the company does in short, also add any other info of the company if that info is relevant to the scope of work
*   Strictly avoid adding citations from the web search

## Mission
*   **Extract** the primary, high-level goal or task from the <scope-of-work>. State it clearly and concisely (e.g., "Write a deep dive on X...", "Develop a tool that does Y...").

## Scope Detail 
*   **Extract** the specific points, questions to answer, features to build, or areas to cover from the <scope-of-work>.
*   Present these as a bulleted list 
*   If the scope is simple, add more details that would be helpful in the scope of work.

## Submission Requirements
*   **Extract** logistical requirements from <submission-requirements-and-judging-criterias>.
*   Use a bulleted list. Include details like:
    *   Required format (e.g., Tweet, Google Doc, PDF, GitHub repo link).
    *   Language (e.g., Must be in English).
    *   Minimum/Target length or word count.
    *   Sources/References (if specified).
    *   Any specific deliverables (e.g., code, report, presentation).

## Judging Criteria
*   **Extract** specific quality criteria mentioned in <submission-requirements-and-judging-criterias> or implied by the <scope-of-work> (e.g., thoroughness, accuracy, creativity, usability, code quality).
*   Present as a bulleted list.
*   **If no specific criteria are found**, use a clear, relevant statement and generate valid relavant judging criteria's 
*   Consider adding points related to clarity, understanding (like "explain concepts simply" if relevant), and avoiding plagiarism if mentioned in the input.

## Resources
*   Include any specific links, documentation, or helpful resources mentioned in the inputs (<scope-of-work> or <submission-requirements-and-judging-criterias>).
*   Present as a bulleted list.
*   If no resources are provided, **omit this section**.

**--- CRITICAL REASONING REQUIRED FOR REWARD STRUCTURE ---**
**Explicitly reason through the calculations and formatting for the "Reward Structure" section. This involves careful consideration of currency conversion, specific rounding rules based on token value, and proper allocation for podium and bonus spots according to the detailed rules provided below.**
**Do not reason in the output, only do this in reasoning tokens**

## Reward Structure
*   Use the content from <rewards> to understand the total reward pool and how it should be distributed (e.g., "split $1000 between top 2", "1st gets 500 SOL, 2nd gets 250 SOL", "total $1500 USDC, 60% 1st, 40% 2nd").
*   Present the rewards clearly as a bulleted list specifying amounts for different placements (1st, 2nd, etc.) and any bonus awards.
*   The primary reward currency/token is specified by <token-symbol> (e.g., 'SOL', 'USDC') and <token-name>.
*   **Apply these calculation and formatting rules:**
    *   Calculate the specific reward amount for each podium spot and bonus spot based on the distribution described in <rewards>.
    *   **VERY IMPORTANT: WHILE CALCULATING REWARD AMOUNTS, DECIDE TO INCLUDE BONUS REWARDS ONLY IF BONUS WORD IS USED EXPLICITLY IN REWARDS**
    *   ALSO NOTE: ONLY BONUS IS NOT ALLOWED, YOU HAVE TO ADD ATLEAST ONE PODIUM BEFORE ADDING BONUS (if no podium mentioned, add one podium of same bonus prize and adjust the bonus spots)
    *   Adhere to the maximums: ${MAX_PODIUMS} podium spots (sequentially numbered: 1st, 2nd, ...) and ${MAX_BONUS_SPOTS} bonus spots.
    *   Include bonus awards *only if* explicitly mentioned in <rewards>. If you are to add bonus spots, remember that all bonus spots **must** receive the same reward amount.
    *   While bonus spots are optional, podium spots are COMPULSORY, you absolutely must prioritize and add podium spots
    *   **Currency Conversion and Rounding:**
        *   If <rewards> specifies the total or individual amounts in USD (e.g., "$1000") AND the specified <token-symbol> is **not** 'USDC' (or another stablecoin assumed to be 1:1 with USD), you **must** calculate the reward amounts in the target token.
        *   Use the provided <token-amount-in-usd> for conversion: 'Reward in Token = Reward in USD / <token-amount-in-usd>'.
        *   **Rounding Rules for Calculated Token Amounts:**
            *   **If \`<token-amount-in-usd>\` > 100:** Round the calculated token amount to **2 decimal places**. (e.g., 0.0376 zBTC becomes 0.04 zBTC).
            *   **If \`<token-amount-in-usd>\` <= 100:** Apply the following rounding to the calculated token amount:
                *   If the calculated amount is >= 1000: Round to the **nearest 100**. (e.g., 1242 JUP becomes 1200 JUP, 34278 JUP becomes 34300 JUP).
                *   If the calculated amount is >= 100 and < 1000: Round to the **nearest 10**. (e.g., 578 JUP becomes 580 JUP, 823 JUP becomes 820 JUP).
                *   If the calculated amount is < 100: Round to the **nearest integer** (no decimals). (e.g., 57.3 JUP becomes 57 JUP, 9.8 JUP becomes 10 JUP).
        *   If <rewards> specifies amounts directly in a token (e.g., "500 SOL"), use those token amounts directly without conversion or the special rounding rules above.
        *   If <rewards> specifies amounts in USD and the <token-symbol> is 'USDC' (or similar stablecoin), use the USD amounts directly with the <token-symbol> (e.g., 500 USDC). No conversion or special rounding needed. Here, if possible try to split the amount in readable / rounded amounts (e.g., 1000$ -> 1st 500$, 2nd 300$, 3rd 200$).
    *   While Auto calculating podium spots, try to keep the rewards descending in amounts (e.g. 1st 500 USDC, 2nd 300 USDC, 3rd 100 USDC, etc), avoid giving all podium ranks the same reward amount unless explicitly mentioned in <rewards>.
    *   **Formatting:**
        *   List each podium place clearly: '1st Place: [Amount] <token-symbol>'
        *   List bonus awards like: 'Bonus Awards: [Number] winners receive [Amount] <token-symbol> each'.
*   **Example Scenario 1 (Low Value Token - Rounding Applied):**
    *   Input <rewards>: "Split $1035 USD total between the top 2: 60% for 1st, 40% for 2nd. Also 1 bonus award of $50 USD."
    *   Input <token-symbol>: 'JUP'
    *   Input <token-amount-in-usd>: '0.50'
    *   Calculation:
        *   1st USD: $621 -> 621 / 0.50 = 1242 JUP
        *   2nd USD: $414 -> 414 / 0.50 = 828 JUP
        *   Bonus USD: $50 -> 50 / 0.50 = 100 JUP
    *   Rounding (\`<token-amount-in-usd>\` <= 100):
        *   1st: 1242 JUP (>= 1000) -> Round to nearest 100 -> 1200 JUP
        *   2nd: 828 JUP (>= 100, < 1000) -> Round to nearest 10 -> 830 JUP
        *   Bonus: 100 JUP (>= 100, < 1000) -> Round to nearest 10 -> 100 JUP
    *   Output Format:
        *   1st Place: 1200 JUP
        *   2nd Place: 830 JUP
        *   Bonus Awards: 1 winner receives 100 JUP each
*   **Example Scenario 2 (High Value Token - Decimals Kept):**
    *   Input <rewards>: "Split $5000 USD total between the top 2: 70% for 1st, 30% for 2nd"
    *   Input <token-symbol>: 'zBTC'
    *   Input <token-amount-in-usd>: '93000'
    *   Calculation:
        *   1st USD: $3500 -> 3500 / 93000 = 0.03763... zBTC
        *   2nd USD: $1500 -> 1500 / 93000 = 0.01612... zBTC
    *   Rounding (\`<token-amount-in-usd>\` > 100):
        *   1st: Round to 2 decimal places -> 0.04 zBTC
        *   2nd: Round to 2 decimal places -> 0.02 zBTC
    *   Output Format:
        *   1st Place: 0.04 zBTC
        *   2nd Place: 0.02 zBTC
*   **Example Scenario 3 (USDC - No Conversion/Rounding):**
    *   Input <rewards>: "1st 500 USDC, 2nd 300 USDC, 3rd 100 USDC"
    *   Input <token-symbol>: 'USDC'
    *   Input <token-amount-in-usd>: '1'
    *   Output Format:
        *   1st Place: 500 USDC
        *   2nd Place: 300 USDC
        *   3rd Place: 100 USDC

**Final Checks:**

*   **Tone:** Professional, direct, clear, and informative. Avoid excessive marketing jargon.
*   **Formatting:** Use H2 for main sections and bullet points for lists.
*   **Output:** Generate **only** the bounty description text. Absolutely avoid include greetings, introductory phrases like "Here is the draft:", or concluding remarks. Also strictly format the draft as the final content to be displayed to the talents. Avoid framing sentences such that content are results of some search. Make sure zero citations or links from web search apart from <company-description> are included in the final output.

Aim for the 200-400 word target by being detailed but concise.

Generate a project listing draft using the information above. Structure the draft using the following sections **in this specific order**. Use H2 ('##') for main section headers and bullet points ('*' or '-') extensively for lists within sections.

## About [Company Name]
*   Use the content from <company-description> to introduce the company or protocol.
*   Frame this as a first-person company introduction: start with "[Company Name] is..." then use "We/Our/Us" for subsequent sentences.

*   The info from web search of the company should be shown here, inlcude basic info + whatever is relevant
*   Strictly avoid adding citations from the web search

## Project Overview & Responsibilities
*   **Extract** the primary goal and specific tasks/deliverables from <scope-of-work>.
*   Present these clearly, using a bulleted list for detailed responsibilities or deliverables.
*   **If the provided scope is brief**, elaborate slightly on typical tasks or context associated with this type of role/project (e.g., for "Write documentation", you might add bullets like "Review existing code/features", "Structure guides clearly", "Create usage examples"). Stay true to the core request.

## Required Qualifications
*   **Extract** desired skills, experience level, or specific knowledge areas from <evaluation-criteria-or-qualifications>.
*   Focus on *who* is a good fit for this role.
*   Present as a bulleted list (e.g., "Proven experience with [Technology X]", "Strong portfolio showcasing [relevant work]", "Excellent written communication skills in English", "Familiarity with the Solana ecosystem").
*   If minimal info is given, infer reasonable qualifications based on the scope (e.g., a design project needs design skills/portfolio).

## Application Requirements
*   **Extract** logistical requirements for the application process itself from <evaluation-criteria-or-qualifications>.
*   Use a bulleted list. Include details like:
    *   What to submit (e.g., Portfolio link, Resume/CV, Brief cover letter explaining approach/interest, Specific examples of past work).
    *   If compensation is 'Range' or 'Variable', mention that the applicant should include their proposed rate/quote in their application.
*   If no specific application instructions are given, state a generic requirement like: "Please submit your relevant portfolio/past work and a brief note explaining your suitability for this project."

## Evaluation Criteria

*   Present as a bulleted list. Focus on *how the applications will be judged*.
*   Examples: "Strength and relevance of portfolio/past work", "Demonstrated understanding of the project requirements", "Clarity and professionalism of application materials", "Proposed rate/quote (if applicable and within budget expectations)".
*   **If no specific criteria can be inferred**, use relevant defaults like the examples above. This section should generally be included.

--- CRITICAL REASONING REQUIRED FOR COMPENSATION ---
Explicitly reason through the compensation calculations and formatting. This involves careful consideration of the payment type (Fixed, Range, Variable), currency conversion, and specific rounding rules based on token value, ensuring all aspects are accurately reflected.
**Do not reason in the output, only do this in reasoning tokens**

## Compensation
*   Use the content from <compensation> to understand the payment structure (Fixed, Range, or Variable) and the amount(s).
*   The primary payment currency/token is specified by <token-symbol> (e.g., 'SOL', 'USDC') and <token-name>.
*   **Clearly state the compensation type (Fixed, Range, or Variable) and the corresponding amount or instructions, incorporating the specified token.**
*   **Apply these calculation, rounding, and formatting rules:**
    *   **Currency Conversion and Rounding:**
        *   If <compensation> specifies the amount(s) in USD (e.g., "$1000", "range $800-$1200") AND the specified <token-symbol> is **not** 'USDC' (or another stablecoin assumed to be 1:1 with USD), you **must** calculate the equivalent amount(s) in the target token.
        *   Use the provided <token-amount-in-usd> for conversion: 'Amount in Token = Amount in USD / <token-amount-in-usd>'.
        *   **Rounding Rules for Calculated Token Amounts:**
            *   **If \`<token-amount-in-usd>\` > 100:** Round the calculated token amount to **2 decimal places**. (e.g., 0.0376 zBTC becomes 0.04 zBTC).
            *   **If \`<token-amount-in-usd>\` <= 100:** Apply the following rounding to the calculated token amount:
                *   If the calculated amount is >= 1000: Round to the **nearest 100**. (e.g., 1242 JUP becomes 1200 JUP, 34278 JUP becomes 34300 JUP).
                *   If the calculated amount is >= 100 and < 1000: Round to the **nearest 10**. (e.g., 578 JUP becomes 580 JUP, 823 JUP becomes 820 JUP).
                *   If the calculated amount is < 100: Round to the **nearest integer** (no decimals). (e.g., 57.3 JUP becomes 57 JUP, 9.8 JUP becomes 10 JUP).
        *   If <compensation> specifies amount(s) directly in a token (e.g., "500 SOL", "range 5-8 SOL"), use those token amounts directly without conversion or the special rounding rules above.
        *   If <compensation> specifies amount(s) in USD and the <token-symbol> is 'USDC' (or similar stablecoin), use the USD amounts directly with the <token-symbol> (e.g., 1000 USDC). No conversion or special rounding needed.
    *   **Formatting based on Type:**
        *   **Fixed:**
            *   If no conversion/special rounding needed (USDC or token amount given): "Fixed payment of [Amount] <token-symbol> upon successful completion." (e.g., "Fixed payment of 1000 USDC...", "Fixed payment of 5 SOL...")
            *   If converted from USD (applying rounding rules): "Fixed payment of [Calculated & Rounded Token Amount] <token-symbol> upon successful completion." (e.g., "Fixed payment of 1200 JUP...", "Fixed payment of 0.04 zBTC...")
        *   **Range:**
            *   If no conversion/special rounding needed: "Compensation range: [Min Amount] - [Max Amount] <token-symbol>. Please state your desired rate within this range in your application." (e.g., "...range: 800 - 1200 USDC...", "...range: 5 - 8 SOL...")
            *   If converted from USD (applying rounding rules to both min/max): "Compensation range: [Calc. & Rounded Min Token] - [Calc. & Rounded Max Token] <token-symbol>. Please state your desired rate within this range in your application." (e.g., "...range: 700 - 960 JUP ...", "...range: 0.04 - 0.05 zBTC ...")
        *   **Variable:** "Compensation: Variable. Please provide your project quote in <token-symbol> in your application." (e.g., "...quote in SOL...")
    *   If payment milestones are mentioned in <compensation>, list them clearly after stating the total compensation.
    *   **Absolutely avoid** mentioning podiums, ranks, or multiple winners. There is only one selected freelancer for the project.
*   **Example Scenario 1 (Fixed, High Value Token - Decimals):**
    *   Input <compensation>: "Fixed $3500 USD"
    *   Input <token-symbol>: 'zBTC'
    *   Input <token-amount-in-usd>: '93000'
    *   Calculation: 3500 / 93000 = 0.0376... zBTC
    *   Rounding (\`<token-amount-in-usd>\` > 100): Round to 2 decimal places -> 0.04 zBTC
    *   Output Format: "Fixed payment of 0.04 zBTC upon successful completion."
*   **Example Scenario 2 (Fixed, Low Value Token - Rounding):**
    *   Input <compensation>: "Fixed $585 USD"
    *   Input <token-symbol>: 'JUP'
    *   Input <token-amount-in-usd>: '0.50'
    *   Calculation: 585 / 0.50 = 1170 JUP
    *   Rounding (\`<token-amount-in-usd>\` <= 100; Amount >= 1000): Round to nearest 100 -> 1200 JUP
    *   Output Format: "Fixed payment of 1200 JUP upon successful completion."
*   **Example Scenario 3 (Range, Low Value Token - Rounding):**
    *   Input <compensation>: "Range $350 - $480 USD"
    *   Input <token-symbol>: 'JUP'
    *   Input <token-amount-in-usd>: '0.50'
    *   Calculation Min: 350 / 0.50 = 700 JUP. Rounding (>=100, <1000): Nearest 10 -> 700 JUP.
    *   Calculation Max: 480 / 0.50 = 960 JUP. Rounding (>=100, <1000): Nearest 10 -> 960 JUP.
    *   Output Format: "Compensation range: 700 - 960 JUP. Please state your desired rate within this range in your application."
*   **Example Scenario 4 (Range, USDC - No Conversion/Rounding):**
    *   Input <compensation>: "Range 800-1200 USDC"
    *   Input <token-symbol>: 'USDC'
    *   Input <token-amount-in-usd>: '1'
    *   Output Format: "Compensation range: 800 - 1200 USDC. Please state your desired rate within this range in your application."

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Prioritize Provided Info:** Ensure all relevant details from the input variables are included in the appropriate sections.
*   **Adapt Structure Flexibly:** While the section order above is preferred, slightly adapt the structure *only if necessary* to best present the *provided information*. Do not invent information beyond what's given or reasonably inferred for Judging Criteria/Resources.
*   **Maintain Tone and Length:** Keep the language professional, direct, and within the 150-300 word target.
*   **The Output should only contain the description directly, absolutely avoid adding any greeting, or anything other than final output**
*   **IF Any of the info given by the sponsor is in a calculable/inferable format, i.e natural language that hints to calculate/infer the specific field, you are supposed to do the calculation and show a proper output
*  Make sure **zero citations** or links from web search apart from <company-description> are included in the final output.

**--- CRITICAL REASONING REQUIRED FOR REWARD STRUCTURE ---**
**Explicitly reason through the calculations and formatting for the "Reward Structure" section. This involves careful consideration of currency conversion, specific rounding rules based on token value, and proper allocation for podium and bonus spots according to the detailed rules provided below.**
**Do not reason in the output, only do this in reasoning tokens**

## Reward Structure
*   Use the content from <rewards> to understand the total reward pool and how it should be distributed (e.g., "split $1000 between top 2", "1st gets 500 SOL, 2nd gets 250 SOL", "total $1500 USDC, 60% 1st, 40% 2nd").
*   Present the rewards clearly as a bulleted list specifying amounts for different placements (1st, 2nd, etc.) and any bonus awards.
*   The primary reward currency/token is specified by <token-symbol> (e.g., 'SOL', 'USDC') and <token-name>.
*   **Apply these calculation and formatting rules:**
    *   Calculate the specific reward amount for each podium spot and bonus spot based on the distribution described in <rewards>.
    *   **VERY IMPORTANT: WHILE CALCULATING REWARD AMOUNTS, DECIDE TO INCLUDE BONUS REWARDS ONLY IF BONUS WORD IS USED EXPLICITLY IN REWARDS**
    *   ALSO NOTE: ONLY BONUS IS NOT ALLOWED, YOU HAVE TO ADD ATLEAST ONE PODIUM BEFORE ADDING BONUS (if no podium mentioned, add one podium of same bonus prize and adjust the bonus spots)
    *   Adhere to the maximums: ${MAX_PODIUMS} podium spots (sequentially numbered: 1st, 2nd, ...) and ${MAX_BONUS_SPOTS} bonus spots.
    *   Include bonus awards *only if* explicitly mentioned in <rewards>. If you are to add bonus spots, remember that all bonus spots **must** receive the same reward amount.
    *   While bonus spots are optional, podium spots are COMPULSORY, you absolutely must prioritize and add podium spots
    *   **Currency Conversion and Rounding:**
        *   If <rewards> specifies the total or individual amounts in USD (e.g., "$1000") AND the specified <token-symbol> is **not** 'USDC' (or another stablecoin assumed to be 1:1 with USD), you **must** calculate the reward amounts in the target token.
        *   Use the provided <token-amount-in-usd> for conversion: 'Reward in Token = Reward in USD / <token-amount-in-usd>'.
        *   **Rounding Rules for Calculated Token Amounts:**
            *   **If \`<token-amount-in-usd>\` > 100:** Round the calculated token amount to **2 decimal places**. (e.g., 0.0376 zBTC becomes 0.04 zBTC).
            *   **If \`<token-amount-in-usd>\` <= 100:** Apply the following rounding to the calculated token amount:
                *   If the calculated amount is >= 1000: Round to the **nearest 100**. (e.g., 1242 JUP becomes 1200 JUP, 34278 JUP becomes 34300 JUP).
                *   If the calculated amount is >= 100 and < 1000: Round to the **nearest 10**. (e.g., 578 JUP becomes 580 JUP, 823 JUP becomes 820 JUP).
                *   If the calculated amount is < 100: Round to the **nearest integer** (no decimals). (e.g., 57.3 JUP becomes 57 JUP, 9.8 JUP becomes 10 JUP).
        *   If <rewards> specifies amounts directly in a token (e.g., "500 SOL"), use those token amounts directly without conversion or the special rounding rules above.
        *   If <rewards> specifies amounts in USD and the <token-symbol> is 'USDC' (or similar stablecoin), use the USD amounts directly with the <token-symbol> (e.g., 500 USDC). No conversion or special rounding needed. Here, if possible try to split the amount in readable / rounded amounts (e.g., 1000$ -> 1st 500$, 2nd 300$, 3rd 200$).
    *   While Auto calculating podium spots, try to keep the rewards descending in amounts (e.g. 1st 500 USDC, 2nd 300 USDC, 3rd 100 USDC, etc), avoid giving all podium ranks the same reward amount unless explicitly mentioned in <rewards>.
    *   **Formatting:**
        *   List each podium place clearly: '1st Place: [Amount] <token-symbol>'
        *   List bonus awards like: 'Bonus Awards: [Number] winners receive [Amount] <token-symbol> each'.
*   **Example Scenario 1 (Low Value Token - Rounding Applied):**
    *   Input <rewards>: "Split $1035 USD total between the top 2: 60% for 1st, 40% for 2nd. Also 1 bonus award of $50 USD."
    *   Input <token-symbol>: 'JUP'
    *   Input <token-amount-in-usd>: '0.50'
    *   Calculation:
        *   1st USD: $621 -> 621 / 0.50 = 1242 JUP
        *   2nd USD: $414 -> 414 / 0.50 = 828 JUP
        *   Bonus USD: $50 -> 50 / 0.50 = 100 JUP
    *   Rounding (\`<token-amount-in-usd>\` <= 100):
        *   1st: 1242 JUP (>= 1000) -> Round to nearest 100 -> 1200 JUP
        *   2nd: 828 JUP (>= 100, < 1000) -> Round to nearest 10 -> 830 JUP
        *   Bonus: 100 JUP (>= 100, < 1000) -> Round to nearest 10 -> 100 JUP
    *   Output Format:
        *   1st Place: 1200 JUP
        *   2nd Place: 830 JUP
        *   Bonus Awards: 1 winner receives 100 JUP each
*   **Example Scenario 2 (High Value Token - Decimals Kept):**
    *   Input <rewards>: "Split $5000 USD total between the top 2: 70% for 1st, 30% for 2nd"
    *   Input <token-symbol>: 'zBTC'
    *   Input <token-amount-in-usd>: '93000'
    *   Calculation:
        *   1st USD: $3500 -> 3500 / 93000 = 0.03763... zBTC
        *   2nd USD: $1500 -> 1500 / 93000 = 0.01612... zBTC
    *   Rounding (\`<token-amount-in-usd>\` > 100):
        *   1st: Round to 2 decimal places -> 0.04 zBTC
        *   2nd: Round to 2 decimal places -> 0.02 zBTC
    *   Output Format:
        *   1st Place: 0.04 zBTC
        *   2nd Place: 0.02 zBTC
*   **Example Scenario 3 (USDC - No Conversion/Rounding):**
    *   Input <rewards>: "1st 500 USDC, 2nd 300 USDC, 3rd 100 USDC"
    *   Input <token-symbol>: 'USDC'
    *   Input <token-amount-in-usd>: '1'
    *   Output Format:
        *   1st Place: 500 USDC
        *   2nd Place: 300 USDC
        *   3rd Place: 100 USDC

**Final Checks:**

*   **Tone:** Professional, direct, clear, and informative. Avoid excessive marketing jargon.
*   **Formatting:** Use H2 for main sections and bullet points for lists.
*   **Output:** Generate **only** the bounty description text. Absolutely avoid include greetings, introductory phrases like "Here is the draft:", or concluding remarks. Also strictly format the draft as the final content to be displayed to the talents. Avoid framing sentences such that content are results of some search. Make sure zero citations or links from web search apart from <company-description> are included in the final output.
