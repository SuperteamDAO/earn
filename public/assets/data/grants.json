    "description": "Get up to $10k to build out a cross-chain future\n\nSuperteam is supporting the Wormhole xGrants! These are grants for projects and communities broadly working on taking crypto cross-chain. Even though the primary focus of the grants is to fund dApps, integrations and technical contribution, we’re happy to support dev tooling projects, educational content, developer tutorials as well as community and media work we’re aligned with. Anyone with an idea and some proof of work is welcome to apply and receive funding decision for a $1 - $10,000 grant within 72 hours. Upon approval by their team, payouts will be made as per Wormhole Foundation’s monthly grant cycle.\n\nAreas of focus\n1. Build xDapps: Use Wormhole to build crosschain dApps (xDapps) which can plug into the liquidity, data, and infrastructure across chains bringing out a massive improvement in UX for its users.\n2. Wormhole Integrations: Integrate the Wormhole Core Layer or the Wormhole Token bridge to your existing dApps to allow multi-chain payments, withdrawals, and authentication.\n3. Dev Tooling: Create tools, programs and hacks making it easier and faster for engineers to build the next generation of xDapps using Wormholes capabilities.\n4. Education: Create videos, articles, explainers, deep dives, and technical tutorials, etc., to onboard users, builders and projects to Wormhole’s ecosystem.\n5. Community: Organize hackathons, university initiatives, workshops and other events to bring Wormhole to your local communities of builders.\n\nNote: We receive tens of applications every week, and may not have the time to give detailed feedback on every application. Please keep that in mind before you apply.\nApply for an Instagrant now.\nIdeas and RFPs:\n1. Cross-chain deposits for in-app assets: Assume there’s game on Solana allows users to buy in-game assets on the platform. First-time users may not have any tokens on Solana to buy the assets. To provide a seamless user experience, the platform prompts first-time users to deposit any supported token from other chains like Ethereum or Polygon. Wormhole (just like Binance) creates one-time deposit addresses based on the user's chain. The user can choose any chain to deposit the token and buy the in-game assets.\n2. Automate cross-chain actions with a scheduler app: Automated contracts with triggers involving multiple chains. For example, a trigger condition can be to buy 10 SOLs at market price on Openbook (Solana’s Order book DEX); if the price of ETH falls below $1500, with USDC stored in the escrow contract on ETH with an expiry date of 21st May 2023.\n3. Create cross-chain identity with a chain agnostic global passport: Identity on blockchains, such as Verifiable Credentials (VCs) or Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), aims to be chain-agnostic or support multiple chains to encourage adoption. Similar to a global passport, identity data like KYC, reputation scores, transactions history, and Credit scores should be interoperable and used across all chains. Good to have: Integrating naming systems as well. Imaging being able to log in with ENS on Solana!\n4. Leverage cross-chain liquidity and create an omni-chain token: Use-case for xAssets - any application can natively mint and burn a single, unified token across various chains supported by Wormhole. To transfer an Omni-chain Token from Chain 1 to Chain 2, the Endpoint on Chain 1 burns the token, records the change in token supply, and creates a message request for the Endpoint on Chain 2 to mint the same amount to the user on Chain 2. For e.g: Real-world Assets aim to be multi-chain by default (like stablecoins). Circle’s CCTP - USDC can be transferred natively from one chain to another by burning USDC on one chain and minting USDC on another, leveraging Wormhole. Build a low-code tool for dApps to launch an omni-chain token and support multiple chains since day one.\n5. Cross-chain lending, i.e. enabling users to deposit assets on one chain and borrow assets on another: Let’s say that Compound wants its users to borrow SOL on Solana against the ETH collateral on Ethereum from the comfort of the Compound front-end. A cross-chain swap using Wormhole could be executed in a single transaction, where:\n    - User deposits ETH into a lending contract on Compound\n    - The contract locks the ETH in the Ethereum-side bridge contract\n    - SOL is released from the Solana-side bridge contract to the user\n    - Big use-case: xChain borrow/lend applications on chains like Solana, which can attract Ethereum users to use Solana dApps by borrowing assets (say USDC) on Solana and depositing their assets on ETH, without actually bridging all their assets into Solana from Ethereum.\n\nHow it works\n1. Submit the application form (won’t take more than 10 minutes!).\n2. Wait for 48 hours to hear back with a decision. In case no approval is received within 48 hours, you can presume that the grant is rejected.\n3. If approved, you'll receive an email notification for onboarding and further steps. 50% of the grant amount will be paid out in the next payout cycle.\n4. As you build, update the Community once a week on your progress, use the community resources, grantees weekly meetings, and talent pool to make your project a reality.\n5. Submit finished work for feedback, review, and distribution, and to receive the pending 50% of the grant amount.\n\nGuidelines\n1. Be concise & precise: Being clear and concise is always helpful. Bonus points of the application contains well-defined technical details (wherever required).\n2. Build what the ecosystem needs: Beyond our listed areas of focus, if you have any unique insight regarding what what the community’s current needs are, feel free to apply for a grant for that as well.\n3. Feasibility: We’ll prefer if you have some relevant proof of work or if you’ve done any prior work that demonstrates feasibility.\n4. Differentiation: Your application should make it clear how you project is differentiated from other similar projects across relevant ecosystems.\n5. Open source: All code produced should be open-sourced. Any content produced free to access and not behind a paywall. And any community activities done written about for others to learn from the effort.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n1. Who is eligible to apply for an Instagrant? \n    a. Anyone! \n2. How fast is \"Instant\"?\n    a. Grant requests are typically approved in 72 hours or less.\n3. What criteria will the panelists use to evaluate grants?\n    a. We prefer projects that 1) yield results quickly and 2) are executable by the Proposing team. \n4. What conditions apply?\n    a. The only condition is that you keep the community updated on a regular basis as your project progresses.\n5. What is the philosophy behind the Instagrants program\n    a. Proof of Work > Credentials. Anyone is welcome to apply for Instagrants, given they have enough Proof of Work to make the review committee believe the work will get done. \n    b. Speed > Perfection. We want to give grants rapidly. Not perfectly. We trust people to get work done.\n    c. Believers > Consensus.

    "title": "Seahorse Language Grants",
    "slug": "seahorse-language-grants",
    "description": "About The Grant\nSuperteam now supports Seahorse Language Grants and recommends applicants with high community reputation scores to the Solana Foundation. These are grants for individuals and teams contributing to core development, educational content, and sample programs for and related to the Seahorse language. The Foundation may also support grants beyond these three stated goals of the Grant program. Anyone with an idea or proof of work is welcome to apply and receive funding decision for a $1 - $2,000 grant. The Foundation hands out these grants typically once in two weeks.\n\n📍Areas of focus and RFPs:\n\n👩‍💻 Code contribution to Seahorse\n- \"Drag-and-drop\" IDL support. Since Seahorse is built on Anchor, it has the potential to easily integrate with other Anchor programs. One way to do this is by adding the ability to import support for Anchor programs by reading their IDL and generating the appropriate bindings, and Rust code to interact with it.\n- Program support for important Solana programs. Non-Anchor programs need to have support added manually, similar to how the Solana token program does. There needs to be a way to compose with these in a safe way (i.e. without having to go through Seahorse's Program.invoke API), while each could also have its own clean interface. Important programs of focus here are Pyth, Openbook (Serum community fork), Solend, etc.\n\n💡 Keep in mind the subject-verb way that the token program instructions are added. Instead of doing a invoke(token_program, accounts, data), one can simply call TokenAccount.transfer(...), and the program usage is inferred. This is the preferred way of adding native support for a program, really making it feel like part of the broader language.\n\n🎓 Tutorials, content and sample programs\n- Intro to the token program. For example, an \"SPL tokens with Seahorse\" would be really important for newcomers in the Solana ecosystem. Bonus: Also cover creating token and mint accounts as PDAs too.\n- Intro to CPIs. Raw, Program.invoke CPIs are one of the coolest new features of v2 imo, but they're difficult to use right now (partially due to lack of support for bytes management).\n- Tic-tac-toe in Seahorse vs Anchor. Tic-tac-toe is the example project shown in the Anchor tutorial, it would be valuable to duplicate this in Seahorse as well, to demonstrate the differences in both.\n- Seahorse for Python programmers. A specific tutorial aimed at Python-native newcomers in crypto, which focusses on how they might need to modify their code for use in Seahorse.\n- Some common programs written in Seahorse. E.g., a simple AMM, a lending program, a lottery program, etc. Bonus points if program is accompanied with a tutorial for recreating the program as well.\n- Optimizing compute budget. Currently, the Seahorse compiler doesn't take steps to optimize generated code, which may lead to some expensive compute. This would definitely be one of the harder tutorials to write, requires some very specific knowledge.\n\n💡 E.g.: How overusing integer constructors (n = u64(10)) leads to a potentially expensive .try_from().unwrap() call under the hood.\n\n💡 The Foundation receive tens of applications every week, and may not have the time to give detailed feedback on every application.

Cause-driven building: We’re also looking to fund projects and research around using crypto to create a more inclusive financial system, and innovative solutions towards climate change.\n\nYou can read more about the Solana Foundation Grants Program here, with some specific RFPs available here as well.\n\n⚙️ How It Works:\n1. Submit the application form (5 minutes).\n2. The Foundation does their best to respond within ~48 hours.\n3. If approved, you'll receive an email notification for onboarding and further steps, and 25% of your requested funding in your SOL wallet will soon follow in our next payout.\n4. Update the community once a week on your progress.\n5. As you achieve your self-described milestones, receive the rest of your funding.\n6. Submit finished work for feedback, review, and distribution.\n\n🤝 Guidelines\n1. Be Concise: Being clear and concise is always helpful.\n2. Build what the ecosystem needs: Besides our Grant Proposals, we often see people on Twitter (and elsewhere) saying things like \"Solana needs X\" or \"Solana would be better if it had Y\". Use this information!\n3. Open Source: Being clear and concise is always helpful. What makes decentralized applications so powerful is that it’s built on the premise of being open and composable. Therefore, this grant support teams that intend to open source soon after deploying on Solana’s Mainnet Beta.\n\n🏆 Previous grant recipients\n- MetaPass - Reimagining Events\n- wagmi.bio - making web3 payments easier\n- Anchor - Visual Studio Marketplace\n- execute.dev\n\n❓Frequently asked questions\n- Who is eligible to apply for an Instagrant? \n    - Anyone! \n- How fast is \"Instant\"?\n    - Grant requests are typically approved in 48 hours or less.\n- What criteria will the panelists use to evaluate grants?\n    - We prefer projects that 1) yield results quickly and 2) are executable by the Proposing team. \n- What conditions apply? \n    - The only condition is that you keep the community updated on a regular basis as your project progresses.\n- What is the philosophy behind the Instagrants program?\n    - Proof of Work > Credentials.

    "description": "Get awarded up to $10,000 in HXRO grants for building with Hxro Network\n\nSuperteam now supports #ProofOfHxro Grants and recommends applicants with high community reputation scores for grants from Hxro Network. #ProofOfHxro grants are for any developer(s) building to either Hxro Network’s Parimutuel Protocol or Dexterity Protocol. Hxro is a distributed liquidity layer, and the primary infrastructure platform for building derivatives trading and betting applications on Solana. Developers can integrate their applications using Hxro’s easy-to-use Python and Typescript SDKs, which allow builders to focus on creating unique user experiences. Anyone with a proof-of-concept application connecting to core Hxro protocols is welcome to apply for the opportunity to be awarded a funding decision valued at up to $10,000 (paid in $esHXRO).\n\nProtocol Overview\n- Parimutuel Protocol\n    - Hxro’s Parimutuel Protocol provides builders with the comprehensive framework necessary to create customizable, peer-to-peer event markets. Parimutuel-style markets allow users to bet on any event where participants finish in a ranked order, paying out the pot to the winning side pro rata.\n- Dexterity Protocol\n    - Dexterity is a flexible, open-source collection of smart contracts that provide the exchange, risk, and settlement functions needed to launch and maintain any type of derivatives contract market.\n\nNote: We receive tens of applications every week, and may not have the time to give detailed feedback on every application. Please keep that in mind before you apply.\nApply for an Instagrant now.\n#ProofOfHxro - Areas of focus for builders\n1. Parimutuel-style markets\n    a. Leverage Hxro’s Parimutuel Protocol to easily create new and novel markets for different types of events (Sports, in-person events, crypto, racing, etc.).\n    b. Create gamified experiences that allow users to interact with Hxro’s Parimutuel Protocol.\n2. Dexterity-powered dAPPs\n    a. Leverage Hxro’s Dexterity SDKs to create the next generation of derivatives DEXes and trading applications\n\nHow it works\n1. Submit the #ProofOfHxro grant application form.\n2. If approved, you will receive an email notification (estimated response time may vary but is estimated to be within 72 hours of submission) with information regarding onboarding and next steps. After signing a Hxro grant program agreement and discussing self-described milestones for product completion, 25% of agreed upon funding will be sent in the form of $esHXRO to your SOL wallet.\n3. Receive the remaining funding to your SOL wallet as you achieve your self-described project milestones.\n4. Submit proof-of-concept work for feedback, review, and distribution!\n\nGuidelines\n1. Open-source: What makes decentralized applications so powerful is that they are built on the premise of being open and composable. Therefore, the #ProofOfHxro grant program will exclusively support builders that intend to open-source shortly after deploying on Solana’s Mainnet Beta.\n2. Build what the ecosystem needs: In addition to the application ideas listed on the Hxro Network Gitbook, we often receive public feedback from Hxro community members (primarily via Twitter and Discord) on project ideas and recommended next steps for the ecosystem. Use this feedback to your advantage when building your product!\n\nFrequently asked questions\n1. Who is eligible to apply for an Instagrant? \n    a. Any team or individual that builds a proof-of-concept application using Hxro Network SDKs for either the Parimutuel Protocol or Dexterity Protocol is eligible to be awarded a #ProofOfHxro Grant.\n2. How fast is \"Instant\"?\n    a. Contributors will work diligently to respond to all grant applicants as quickly as possible. Applicants should expect to hear back within 72 hours of their initial submission, but response time may vary. Further processing time will depend on the review requirements and complexity of the application.\n3. What criteria will the panelists use to evaluate grants?\n    a. Grant requests will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The awarded grant amount will be contingent on the complexity and/or novelty of the proof-of-concept project and your vision for what it can become in the future.\n4. What conditions apply?\n    a. Builders accepted to the #ProofOfHxro grant program are required to keep the Hxro community updated on a regular basis as your project progresses\n5. What is the philosophy behind the Instagrants program\n    a. Proof of Work > Credentials. Anyone is welcome to apply for Instagrants, given they have enough proof-of-work to assure the review committee that the work will be completed.\n    b. Speed > Perfection. The goal is to give #ProofOfHxro grants rapidly, not perfectly. The Foundation trusts ambitious builders to get work done!\n    c. Believers > Consensus. As long as a minimum quorum of the reviewing committee believes that the project is a good use of funds, a grant will be awarded.\n\nHave a question about #ProofOfHxro that isn't answered above?
